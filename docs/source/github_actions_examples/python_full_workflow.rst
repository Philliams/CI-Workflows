Sample Full Python Github Actions Workflow
**************************************************************

From the simple workflow and simple python workflow, we have all the tools we need to implement a full python CI.
This will include linting, running tests, compiling coverage reports and building documentation.

The main additions to this workflow is the use of a `pre-commit` to perform linting and type checking of the python code:

.. code-block::
    :caption: Linting with pre-commit

    - name: Lint with precommit
      uses: pre-commit/action@v3.0.0

Running some tests and copying the code coverage report to the `/docs/` folder:

.. code-block::
    :caption: Tests and code coverage

    - name: Run pytest and compile coverage report
      run: |
        python -m pytest --cov=src unittests/ --cov-report term --cov-report html:./docs/source/_static/code_cov/

Building the Sphinx documentation from `/docs/source` to `/docs/build`:

.. code-block::
    :caption: Build Sphinx documentation

    - name: Sphinx build
        run: |
          cp -a ./.github/workflows/. ./docs/source/_static/github_actions
          sphinx-build -b html ./docs/source ./docs/build
          sphinx-build -b doctest ./docs/source ./docs/build

Finally, the last item will be to use the gh-pages action to create a github-pages branch, and publish the HTML files generated by the Sphinx docs to the gh-pages branch.
This means that the documentation itself will be deployed statically from within the repo itself.

.. code-block::
    :caption: Deploy documentation to github-pages

    - name: Deploy documentation to gh-pages
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}
        with:
          publish_branch: gh-pages
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./docs/build/
          force_orphan: true
