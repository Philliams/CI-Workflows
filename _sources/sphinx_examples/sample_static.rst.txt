Sample Static Page
*************************************

This page is an example of a simple static page written using reStructuredText.

Alternatively, you can use Sphinx directives to accomplish additional cool stuff. For example, a code block:

.. code-block::
   :caption: A code block example

    def dummy_function():
        pass

.. This is a comment block that does not show up in the documentation
